It was a place where he felt annoyed. <br>

He was a friendly, intelligent, tea drinker with fast fingers and beautiful eyes. His friends saw him as a angelic, caring deity. Once, he had even helped a fierce gorilla recover from a car accident. That's the sort of man he was.<br>

Lauren walked over to the window and reflected on his deprived surroundings. The moon shone like attacking wolves.<br>

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Billy Ramsbottom. Billy was a horrible demon with a big body and was tall.<br>

Lauren gulped. He was not prepared for Billy.<br>

As Lauren stepped outside and Billy came closer, he could see the raspy glint in his eye.<br>

Billy glared with all the wrath of 9755 forgetful magnificent monkeys. He said, in hushed tones, "I hate you and I want revenge."<br>

Lauren looked back, even more annoyed and still fingering the red guillotine. "Billy, you are a horrible person," he replied.<br>

They looked at each other with shocked feelings, like two wise, obedient owls thinking at a very demanding battlefield, which had piano music playing in the background and two daring foes fighting to the beat.<br>

Lauren studied Billy's big body and tall height. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Lauren in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't hate you Billy."<br>

Billy looked sad, his emotions raw like a lettuce, looked at Lauren.<br>

Lauren could actually hear Billy's emotions shatter into 170 pieces. Then the horrible demon hurried away into the distance.<br>

Not even a cup of tea would calm Lauren's nerves tonight.<br>
